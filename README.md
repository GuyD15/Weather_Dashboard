# Weather_Dashboard

## Description
This weather dashboard with interesting colors is able to tell you the weather in the cities you're looking for. It's coded to show you the measurements in fahrenheit, mph, and humidity percentage. It's responsive and optimized for different screen sizes. 

I had a hard time getting the formats correct. Moving around containers and changing properties for a while eventually made the app bearable to look at.
